The email subject was 
> It wasn't a match this time, sorry

Most of the time it's so obvious if I see some texts starts with "congra" that means I could wait for picking up their phone call etc., the rest are all rejections in general.

The tone of the this email is from a first person but as I read I found out it must machine generated.

> I wanted to personally thank you for taking the time to learn more about the Engineering Manager - Machine Learning Platform position at Canva. It was so great to hear about your interest in the role, but unfortunately, we have decided not to move forward with your application.

> I know it takes time and energy to submit an application, so I appreciate this news may be disappointing. But even though it's not a match this time, that doesn’t mean there won’t be another opportunity with us in the future that's even better suited to your unique skill set.

> We’d love you to keep an eye out for other positions you might be interested in so why not keep in touch with us and join our Talent Community if you haven't already?

> And in the meantime, you can jump on over to our socials to find out more about what it's like to work at Canva.

 

> We truly appreciate your interest in Canva and wish you all the best with your job search.

> Best wishes,

> Canva Talent Acquisition Team


They put two social media icons with hyperlinks in the email, instagram and Linkedin. It'll never be response if I join their community and it'll totally a waste of time. Imagine how many people in the community and only a few VIP are active and being paid attention to while the rest are just contributing to the community's population.
