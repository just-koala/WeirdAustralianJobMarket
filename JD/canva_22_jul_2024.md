##### Engineering Manager - Machine Learning Platform

Job Description
Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.

Hey, hello, hiya, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

What you’d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

At the moment, this role is focused on:

Developing and delivering the long-term vision for accelerating the delivery of robust, innovative and safe machine learning across the MLOps stack: data, prototyping, training and production.
Owning and driving the delivery of large, cross-team, and cross-group initiatives and projects from ideation to completion, with autonomy and independence of decision making.
Coaching a team of 5 engineers by providing regular, practical feedback and collaboratively help them reach their personal growth goals.
Owning the team’s development methodology and rituals such as sprint planning, stand-ups, retrospectives.
Collaborating with the Product Manager to understand and contribute to the roadmap.
Planning goals and defining success metrics to ensure there is alignment between the company, group, and teams.
Championing a culture of knowledge sharing and communication across engineering and effectively advocate for ML engineering needs to stakeholders within Canva.
You're probably a match if:

You have a history of success in technical people leadership and mentorship of engineers.
You’ve got experience in platform engineering, designing and building complex, distributed systems, ideally involving Machine Learning.
You have first principles thinking - using deep understanding of a problem space to make informed decisions. Even if these decisions are radically different from what others might be doing, Canva is a unique company, solving unique problems and this sometimes requires us to make bold decisions.
You can bring a deep passion for platform engineering & empowering engineering to create business value.
You have excellent problem-solving skills, with the ability to break large projects down into smaller ones and deliver on them through others.
You’ve got proven expertise in inspiring others to achieve their full potential and enable the engineers within your team to do novel, impactful work.
